# Installation
## Prerequisites/Requirements
- A web server capable of running PHP >= 7.0, Laravel >= 5.0, and a MySQL database. (recommended for running locally: [Ampps](https://www.ampps.com/))
-  [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed
-  [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed

## Install

Installing TaskManager locally is easy and can be completed with just a few quick steps.

 1.  In your database manager, create an empty MySQL database named `task_manager`. If you choose to select a different name, please be sure to update your `.env` file (more in **Step 3**).

 2. **Setup:**
	 * **Windows**: In **Command Promt** on Windows, type `yarn run setup-taskmanager`. This is going to run several commands from cloning TaskManager's GitHub repository to installing all required dependencies and copying the `.env` file. *The script will likely take several minutes to complete.*
		 > **NOTE**: this command will work only from within a **Command Prompt** terminal on **Windows**. If you would like to install using another terminal such as Bash, open the `package.json` file in TaskManager's root directory, locate the `setup-taskmanager` script, and run each command (seperated by a ` && `) seperately. When you reach the `copy .env.example .env` command, do **not** run it and instead manually copy the `.env.example` file, naming it `.env`.
	 
	 - **Mac**: If you are using a Mac, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/j-651/TaskManager/issues) and/or [PR](https://github.com/j-651/TaskManager/pulls) to add a Mac-friendly install script.

 3. In your newly created `.env` file, ensure all information relating to your database and server configuration is accurate. This includes your database's username, password, and the TaskManager database name setup in **Step 1**.

 4. Next, in a terminal of your choice, run `php artisan migrate`. This will import the necessary table(s) to your database.
	 > **NOTE**: `migrations`, `users`, and `password_resets` tables will also be created when running this. Although `migrations` is required, the other two relevant to users (not tasks) can be removed from the `database\migrations` directory. These are default Laravel migrations and will likely be used if TM gets authentication in the future.

<p align="center">To launch TaskManager in your browser, please refer to the <b><em>Usage</em></b> section below.</p>

# Usage
In order for TaskManager to load properly, your MySQL database and PHP server (Apache) **must** be running every time you want to use TM.

To launch TaskManager locally, open your terminal at TaskManager's root directory and type `php artisan serve`. In your browser, navigate to where it's being served, typically at `localhost:8000` or `127.0.0.1:8000`.

> **NOTE**: TaskManager is still in development. Some features may not be documented or fully implemented *(some people call these bugs, so please [open an issue](https://github.com/j-651/TaskManager/issues) if you encounter one)*.
